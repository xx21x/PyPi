 Calculate Pi digits up to 10^9.

 This Python program use Decimal module to calculate Pi with desired precision.  On my 2018 MacBook Pro, it can calculate Pi  to 10^9  digits in a week. More digits were not been tested.
 
 This program only use single thread so it can only test single core performance.
 
 There are 3 different algorithms to cross check the result.
